# Onyx-Data-Monthly-Challenges
This repository will show a monthly addition based on the onyx-DATA challenge. Most of these would be done using SQL Server and Tableau

## April 2022:
  This month the challenge is about Formula 1. Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport and the challenge is to find out and showcase which
  team and driver have shown dominance or are the most succesful in the sport's 71 years of existence. 
  
  Here is the link to the queries done: [F1_Query](https://github.com/mr-williams/Onyx-Data-Monthly-Challenges/blob/main/F1_Query.sql).
